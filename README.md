DelaunayRaster
==============

A script that tried to create a low poly 2D approximation of an image.
**Requires Toxiclibs.**

Algorithm
---------
An explanation of the algorithm is available [on my Behance portfolio](https://www.behance.net/gallery/14180619/Automatic-Triangulation).

Controls
--------
Keyboard shortcuts, press keys during the program:

* **'d'**: Inject *maxPoints* points in the triangulation. 
* **'c'**: Inject a number of random points in triangulation.
* **'r'**: Enables recording of screenshots (for video making).
* **'p'**: Prints out structure on a PDF.
